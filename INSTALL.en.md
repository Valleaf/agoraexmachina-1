## Installation

### Preamble

**AgoraExMachina** is developed using the Symfony Framework. It is necessary :

* either to install the package manager `Composer` to your php/MySQL server
* or use `composer.phar` to allow packet acquisition.

### With composer

`composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`

`php bin/console doctrine:database:create`

`php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force`

### With composer.phar

`php composer.phar install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` in the agoraexmachina directory

`php bin/console doctrine:database:create`

`php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force`

### Post-installation procedure

* In a browser, go to the AEM administration interface (http://mondomaine.com/agoraexmachina/public)
* Register

### And then

* It is possible to modify a number of variables in the `config/services.yaml` file, among them :
  * the name of your site (displayed in the menu and in the title tag of the `html` page.
  * The name of the structure that houses the site
  * The language, lang and writing (for some tags, see the `templates/base.html.twig` file for more details).

## Remarks
The liquid democracy solution is under development, and some installation bugs remain. Don't despair during installation. These few tips will surely help you: 

* Perform a local mode installation first. Once this operation is successful, you will have access to all the Symfony packages in the vendor directory. 
* If you try to install AEM using the commands `composer install --nodev --optimize --autoloader` and you receive error messages, you can copy the `vendor` directory to the root of your remote directory. Then by repeating the same command lines, your installation will run smoothly.
* When installing the database, if you get error messages about an invalid `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, you will have to do this installation manually by exporting the code of the database tables (from `user`) and to install the tables directly, for example from your phpMyAdmin interface, correcting the string *utf8mb4_unicode_ci* for the `user` table with *utf8_unicode_ci*. This procedure can be applied to all `user' tables, and following ones.

For any bug related to the installation, please contact the author.**
